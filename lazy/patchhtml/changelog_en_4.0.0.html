    <h2 class="mume-header" id="swap-hands-modifiers">Swap Hands modifiers</h2>

    <p>One-handed weapons can now be wielded two-handed and two-handed weapons the other way around. All modifiers are
        included. You are allowed to swap hands once every time it is your turn in combat. Using a shield with a spear
        is now possible!</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="new-item-information">New item &quot;information&quot;</h2>

    <p>The new item type &quot;information&quot; is now available. It can start a roll check to define how many
        information an user knows about a specific topic. The player or GM (configurable in the settings) receives a
        whispered message according to the result of the roll and can then process the information as he sees fit (e.g.
        tell the other players). We updated all the creatures to include those informations where necessary. Later on we
        will also update all plants.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="artifact-creation">Artifact creation</h2>

    <p>The core module now brings an artifact creation helper to the player menu. It assists in creating magical
        artifacts by showing all roll modifiers, costs and other important parts of the process. We will probably add
        more helpers for complex rule elements like this in the future.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="active-effects-for-weapons-and-other-items">Active Effects for weapons and other items
    </h2>

    <p>Active effects can now modify other items. You can now create e.g. a ring which modifies your preferred weapon
        and increases the attack mod value.<br>
        This will come in handy for special abilites for traditional artifact items and the like. We will add those to
        the compendiae at a later time. Fields that have been modified by such an active effect can not be changed
        manually anymore until the effect is gone!<br>
        Example key: &quot;@meleeweapon.Dagger.system.atmod.value, mode: add, value 2 - would increase the attack value
        of each item named dagger of type meleeweapon by 2</p>
    <h1 class="mume-header" id="enhancements">Enhancements</h1>

    <ul class="dsalist">
        <li>Active Effects of special abilites, advantages and disadvantages are now applied according to their level x
            times</li>
        <li>The master menu has now a button to drag all tracked actors at the same time to the canvas</li>
        <li>The library has now a loading bar, so you know what&apos;s going on</li>
        <li>You can now drag actors from the master menu directly to the canvas</li>
        <li>You can now disable the combat regeneration of creatures (e.g. if you hit the werewolf with a silver sword)
        </li>
        <li>The stituational modifiers should have a more helpful tooltip now</li>
        <li>Traditional artifact special abilities now have their respective artifact as icon so they can be found
            easier in the library</li>
        <li>The TDE journal sheet style can now for the most part be deactivated by switching the journal sheet</li>
        <li>A few tours have been added</li>
        <li>The tooltips have been migrated to the v10 default style</li>
        <li>Regeneration rolls can now be selective (e.g. only AE, LE)</li>
        <li>Actors now have a method to detect the creature class which can be used to define e.g. blood colors for the
            module splatter. The core module contains a predefined macro to set those colors (thanks to VTTom). You can
            modify it to your likings.</li>
        <li>We added a few more map note icons</li>
        <li>An automatic self-control check request is now posted to the chat whenever an actor receives 4 level of
            pain, so he can try to avoid becoming incapacitated (this can be disabled in the options)</li>
        <li>TDE is now bundled and compressed which should improve loading time (a bit experimental)</li>
        <li>Enabling or disabling access of books for the players now also shows or hides the connected compendiae</li>
        <li>Automatic renaming of tokens dropped to the canvas can now be done without numbering</li>
        <li>The lighthelper in the core module has now all light settings available. Moreover the token player HUD can
            now be customized with own light configurations.</li>
        <li>GM arbitrariness now also works for hitzones</li>
        <li>The &quot;did you know message&quot; now fades after 8s (instead of 4) and the fade can be stopped entirely.
            After the stop you can request more messages. Just hit the right button.</li>
        <li>Ini and movement modifiers for zone armor should be calculated properly now (thanks to Qowy)</li>
        <li>The creature type detection now also works for the &quot;npc&quot; and &quot;character&quot; sheet (instead
            of &quot;creature&quot; only). Keep in mind that the species field is readonly as the species should only be
            dragged to the character to ensure all base attributes are set properly. To make the detection work, you
            need to create an active effect which overrides the species name (this is included in the lykanthropie and
            wercreature conditions)</li>
        <li>Status effects of actors can now be transferred to other actors via drag and drop (drag icon)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="mume-header" id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h1>

    <ul class="dsalist">
        <li>Parry rolls should now properly show the token name instead of the actor name</li>
        <li>Fixed calculation of wercreature damage modifiers</li>
        <li>Fixed level depiction of general special abilities for the character sheet</li>
        <li>Auto pan to token in combat shouldn&apos;t occur so excessive anymore</li>
    </ul>
