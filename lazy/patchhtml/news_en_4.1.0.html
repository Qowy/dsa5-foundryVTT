                At the beginning of the third adventure of the Raven War campaign for Foundry VTT, the heroes have proven themselves reliable and prudent enough to receive their next task from Oderin du Metuant himself. Soon they find themselves in moral quandaries and may have to resort to rather unorthodox means to fulfill the Black General's will after all.                  </p><p>
                    Raven War 3 - The Fall of the Eagle can also be played separately from the campaign background and is suitable for a group of 3 - 6 heroes.            </p>
