    <h2>Foundry v10</h2>
    <div class="row-section">
        <div class="col sixty">
            <p>Foundry v10 has arrived. We made all necessary underlying changes to the code (thousands of changes; especially thanks to VTTom for lots of testing) and incorporated some of the new features.<br>
                The highlights of v10 include improved journals, vision modes, tours and many other things. This will also conclude our support for v9. Any future update and module will only be available from v10+. Due to the hight amount of required changes, we unfortunately expect some more bugs in early TDE 4.x.x versions.</p>
